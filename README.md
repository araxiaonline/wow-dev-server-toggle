# wow-dev-server-toggle
Simple helper to make it easier to switch between dev and production realmlist.  Follow the instructions then create a shortcut on your desktop to enable quick toggling between environments 
(Prod and Dev). 

I also included an icon you can use for the Shortcut if you want. 

## Instructions
1. Create two files in your realmlist besides your main realmlist.wtf realmlist.prod.wtf and realmlist.dev.wtf.  Configure the environments correctly. 
2. Open switch_server.ps1 - update file with correct folder path to where your realmlist.wtf 
3. Open switch_server.bat and update file path to folder where realmlist.wtf 
4. Create a shortcut and add the icon and target to the bat. all done
